## Article Abstract
>The potential for modern coalfield methanogenesis was assessed using formation water from the Illinois Basin, Powder River Basin, and Cook Inlet gas field as inocula for nutrient-replete incubations amended with C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> fatty acids as presumed intermediates formed during anaerobic coal biodegradation. Instead of the expected rapid mineralization of these substrates, methanogenesis was inordinately slow (∼1 μmol•day<sup>−1</sup>), following long lag periods (>100 day), and methane yields typically did not reach stoichiometrically expected levels. However, a gene microarray confirmed the potential for a wide variety of microbiological functions, including methanogenesis, at all sites. The Cook Inlet incubations produced methane at a relatively rapid rate when amended with butyrate (*r* = 0.98; *p* = 0.001) or valerate (*r* = 0.84; *p* = 0.04), a result that significantly correlated with the number of positive mcr gene sequence probes from the functional gene microarray and was consistent with the in situ detection of C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> alkanoic acids. This finding highlighted the role of syntrophy for the biodegradation of the softer lignite and subbituminous coal in this formation, but methanogenesis from the harder subbituminous and bituminous coals in the other fields was less apparent. We conclude that coal methanogenesis is probably not limited by the inherent lack of metabolic potential, the presence of alternate electron acceptors, or the lack of available nutrients, but more likely restricted by the inherent recalcitrance of the coal itself.
